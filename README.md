Simple project here for messing around with [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).  For ease, `nodemon` is also used so that the `index.js` file will be re-run each time it is saved.

The picture to the right is a playground.  Although this library is about Immutable, the picture of the playground to the right has nothing to do with Immutable.  I guess certain elements of the playground couldn't mutate, I suppose.

### To make it work
```
npm start
```

### To make it stop
```
control-c
```

### To make it update

Make a change to `index.js` and then save it.  Watch the console update.


Ok, that's all.
